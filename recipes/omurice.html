    <p>    
        This Kimchi Omurice packs Korean-style kimchi fried rice, with its 
        mild umami, spicy, sour, garlic flavor profile into a slightly runny omelet 
        in the style of Japanese omurice. The flavors and textures work amazingly well 
        together, making this dish super comforting for practically any person of any age.

        If you have had either kimchi fried rice or omurice by itself, you have 
        a sense of what is possible here.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Make kimchi fried rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix well.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Heat the butter (or oil) in a large skillet over medium-high 
            heat until hot. Add the kimchi and onions. Stir fry for 30 
            seconds to 1 minutes to draw out excess moisture from the kimchi.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the rice. Stir and chop to break it up with a spatula. 
            Cook until the kimchi and onions are evenly mixed through the rice.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the sauce and frozen vegetables. Cook and stir until the rice is 
            evenly coated and the vegetables are fully thawed. Divide the rice
            into 2 even portions and transfer to 2 separate plates.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Make the omelet</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add 2 (or 3 if using) eggs into separate small bowls. Add half the 
            salt and milk/cream (if using) to each bowl. Beat the eggs until they’re 
            evenly mixed but not foamy.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Spray a medium-sized (9”) nonstick pan (*Footnote 3) with a thin layer of 
            oil. If not using oil spray, add 1 teaspoon oil to the pan and use a paper 
            towel to wipe the pan evenly with oil. Heat the pan over medium heat until 
            the pan is warm.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the eggs and immediately begin scrambling using a spatula. Scramble for 
            20 to 30 seconds, or until the bottom is just set and the top is still runny. 
            Then cook undisturbed to let the eggs set for 30 seconds, or until the top of 
            the eggs become thick and creamy, but not fully set. If the eggs are still too runny, 
            you can also cover the pan with a lid, turn off the heat, and let it steam for 20 to 30 
            seconds. This step helps the eggs to set slowly without burning the bottom.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assemble the omurice</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Work on one omurice at a time.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Shaping method 1: Shape the plated rice into a long (American) football shape using 
            a spatula. Put the skillet with the omelet near the plate and use a swift motion to 
            flip the egg onto the rice, runny side down. Use two layers of paper towels to cover 
            the egg, then use your hands to shape the dome, gently pressing the rice together. One 
            side at a time, tuck both sides of the omelet to slide it under the rice.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Shaping method 2: Add half of the rice to one side of the omelet as if you were filling 
            a Western-style omelet. Then fold the other half of the omelet over it. Carefully flip 
            the omelet onto a plate so that the seam is facing down.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Shaping method 3: Add half of the rice into a small bowl and press it to mold the rice
            into a dome. Flip the rice onto a serving plate. Slide the omelet over the rice to 
            cover it completely.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            To serve, garnish with ketchup on the eggs or serve it on the side.
        </li>
    </ol>
